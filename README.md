============

MySQL on Docker.

Includes a bunch of useful features such as:

 - Exporting volumes so your data persists.
 - Not running as root.
 - Printing log output.
 - Setting a root password when starting.

Here's how it works:

    $ docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=xehVg1IpVhEmlwRMG orchardup/mysql
    da809981545f
    $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p
    Enter password:
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 1
    Server version: 5.5.34-0ubuntu0.12.04.1-log (Ubuntu)
